# ModellingScaleEvolution
Main code used to study scale evolution in, "Melody predominates over harmony in the evolution of musical scales across 96 countries"

This code is released for the purposes of replication, and extension, of the above work.
The code is written in a modular fashion that should allow users to repeat the analysis with
different theories of how scales evolved. Likewise, code such as "Src/generate_scales.py" can be
used to generate theoretical popoulations of scales, and includes tools for checking convergence.
