# Summary of python modules

* "cost_functions.py"   :: Cost functions for all models. Also precomputes cost functions for interval sizes.
* "evaluate_models.py"  :: Runs the main model comparison code. Generates probabilities for models, given the data.
* "generate_scales.py"  :: Contains a scale generator. Also runs specific scale generation / evaluation procedures.
* "interval_constraints.py" :: Testing theories on how well they can predict step size distributions.
* "interval_stats.py"   :: Testing whether intervals are found more or less than expected by chance.
* "paper_figs.py"       :: Main figures in the paper. Figures 1-5.
* "prepare_datasets.py" :: Code used to prepare the dataset. Only included for transparency purposes.
* "prod_variance.py"    :: Code used to calculate variance during singing. Only included for transparency purposes.
* "scales_config.py"    :: Some global variables.
* "scales_io.py"        :: Some input/output functions.
* "scales_utils.py"     :: Some miscellaneous functions.
* "si_figs.py"          :: Supplementary figures.
* "weighted_sampling.py"    :: Controlling for raw data that is not distributed evenly across geographic regions.
